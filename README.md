# Pancake

Pancake is my personal Relational-DBMS project. It is intended to envolve in four steps:

1. **single-threaded DBMS without transaction** (working)
2. single-threaded DBMS with single transaction
3. multi-threaded DBMS with multiple transactions

## Contributing

It is recommended that you read the [design documentation](docs/design.md) first.
