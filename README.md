# Pancake

Pancake is my personal Relational-DBMS project. It is inspired by _RedBase_ of Stanford [CS346](https://web.stanford.edu/class/cs346/2015/) course and can be considered as a Java implementation of RedBase.

Pancake is intended to envolve in the following three steps:

1. **single-threaded DBMS without transaction** (working)
  + paged file (working)
  + record management (working)
  + index
  + system management
  + query language
2. single-threaded DBMS with single transaction
3. multi-threaded DBMS with multiple transactions
